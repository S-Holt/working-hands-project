                        <p> Go on, tell me<br>
                            My hands look like yours,<br>
                            Nail clipped, filed, buffed, shined.<br>
                            They weren’t always so.<br>
                            My hands were<br>
                            <br>
                            Forged from<br>
                            Gardening, working so deep<br>
                            In the soil, they could have been roots.<br>
                            Fingers splintered by wooden<br>
                            Rakes and shovels.<br>
                            <br>
                            Some gardener—<br>
                            Whose face and name get lost<br>
                            Like loose coins in my memory’s<br>
                            backseat—told me women<br>
                            Look at men’s hands<br>
                            <br>
                            For dark half-circles<br>
                            Between their nails, which give away<br>
                            Your blue-collar status like a pair of <br>
                            torn jeans. This is no matter how <br>
                            handsome your face. I knew I had hope.<br>
                            <br>

                        <p> But what about<br>
                            Lupe, whose mower chopped<br>
                            His fingertips instead of blades of grass,<br>
                            Who then preserved them in an ice chest<br>
                            Next to some plums?<br>
                            <br>
                            So I scrub, clip,<br>
                            And lotion my hands with aloe,<br>
                            Fearing bachelorhood and Internet dating.<br>
                            I take pride in my hands now,<br>
                            But what about when<br>
                            <br>
                            The skin gathers at the knuckle,<br>
                            And arthritis tangles my fingers for<br>
                            Cracking my knuckles since I was ten?<br>
                            But until then, hold my hand<br>
                            Tightly with yours<br>
                            <br>
                            As my other hand<br>
                            Wipes the sweat from my brow<br>
                            Under the perspiration of work and love<br>
                            And the fact I know no other way<br>
                            To wrestle out a life for us.<br>
                            <br>
